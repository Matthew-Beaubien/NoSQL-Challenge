## NoSQL Challenge/Social Network API

Although I believe that I have everything im supposed to, it seems as though mongoose or mongodb are not letting me connect. I will continue to look into this and see if i can figure out the problem.
The user is supposed to be able to run npm start and then pull up insomnia to see the social network api.
